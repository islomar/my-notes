## The secret to better decisions

- What do you make?: decisions
- The purpose of this short course is to help identify the single thing that gets in the way of passionate, connected, educated, smart people making better decisions.
- Three pieces:
  1. Are you making the change you seek to make? Are you getting the results that matter to you?
  2. Are your decisions holding you back? Are there places you would like to go or you're not getting because of the decisions that you've been making?
  3. Is your attachment to the chips holding you back being used against you?
- Almost all the bad decisions in our life come from a single flaw. We **hoard the chips**. We pay attention to the chips, the chips that we worked so hard to get and we don't want to let them go.
- The line at the store: people are more likely to stick something out if it costs them something to be there >> sunk cost
- The kayaks covered with dust: basal cost. Why do we hold on to that boat, even though it costs us money? And the reason is we don't want to confront the decision, the decision of getting rid of it. As long as we just put it on the back burner, as long as we assert to ourselves **emotionally** that it's not our problem today, we don't have to deal with the indecision, with the angst, with the cost of making a decision. It's easier to just hold on to our chips. And sometimes this idea that you will have to hold on tight to what you've got can be used against us
- **Car dealers**: you take it home pending financing... The next day, the car dealer tells you that the financing was denied. Will you take it back or pay more?
- **Overbooking after sitting at a flight**: would you take 400$ to take a flight one hour later. You would have done while reserving online and probably when accessing the airport. It is less probable once you are sitting inside the airplane.
- **The green iguana**. So buying a green iguana is a lot more fun than owning a green iguana, because what you end up with is this series of investments, emotional and financial, in this pet that ends up not serving your needs or the pet's needs.
- **The unhappy dentist**:
  - In one study of career satisfaction, dentists ranked in the bottom third of all jobs.
  - They'd rather be unhappy than let go of the chips they're hoarding. I am not saying that every unhappy dentist should quit tomorrow. There are lots of steps
  - My opinion: creo que es muy atrevida y superficial su conclusión...
- **Western Union and Random House traps**: they could have becom AT&T or Google
- **The mythical monkey trap**:
  - And the theory goes that the monkey will see this, reach inside, grab the banana, and won't be able to get his fist out. And then, instead of just opening his hand and running away, he will be trapped because he cannot let go of the banana.
  - We can't let go of it for so many reasons. "What will I tell my friends? What will I tell myself? How will I deal with the bad decision I made before? If I pretend it wasn't a bad decision...
- **Assets are a gift from your former self**... but you don't have to take the gift. Story of Quentin Tarantino's first movie and paving work with wrong naming. You can say "no, thank you".
- The costs of hoarding your chips:
  - One of the reasons for this, about the chips, about how we deal with the chips is **volatility**. It is easy to believe that anything that we put effort in to acquiring is going to continue to go up in value, but it might not.
- The costs of hoarding your chips
  - **Carrying costs**: you don't always benefit from holding your chips
  - **Opportunity costs**: while you're holding the chips, your hands are full and so you're prevented from doing something else.
  - Transfer cost: but walking away from a gift can be expensive

## The steps to better decisions

- Making better decisions together
  - Figure out what you already own, where the gifts you've been given are. Is it your reputation? Is it the benefit of the doubt? Is it what you've learnt? Is it what you've got in your garage?
  - Open your hand and take it out of the trap. We need to practice the thought that we can walk away.
  - Evaluate the carrying costs.
  - And add in the opportunity costs.
  - Then decide if you want the chips
- Conclusion
  - Sunk costs are a gift from your former self (and the organization doesn't have to accept that gift)

## Bonus: interview with Annie Duke

  - "Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don’t Have All the Facts”"
- Tendemos a pensar, erróneamente, que si ocurre algo "bueno" es porque habíamos tomado una buena decisión. Y si ocurre algo "malo" es porque habíamos tomado una mala decisión.
- The science says that we stick to things too long (e.g. because of sunk cost). Also cognitive disonance.
- "If you quit on time, you will feel that you quit too early".
- "Any two cards can win" means that there's always some chance that things could go your way >> "but not enough of the time to make it profitable in the long run"
-  The path to certainty is actually through persevering. And what we would prefer is to know for sure, even if that's bad news, because then we have the peace of mind of knowing. And I think that's just a siren song that calls you to a very bad place.
