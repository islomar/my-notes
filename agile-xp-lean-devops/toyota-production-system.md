## Preface

- The TPS evolved out of need: restrictions in the marketplace required the production of **small** quantities of many varieties under conditions of **low demand**, a fate the Japanese automobile industry had faced in the postwar period.
- Objective: increase production **efficiency** by consistently and thoroughly eliminating **waste**.
- **Respect for humanity**
- Founder of the company: Toyoda Sakichi.
- The TPS implementation begun soon after the WWII. It started attracting attention during the first oil crisis (1973).
- The world has already changed from a time when industry could sell everything it produced to an affluent society where material needs are routinely met. Social values have changed..
- All kinds osf wastes occur when we try to produce the same product in large, homogeneous quantities. It is much more economical to make each item one at a time.
- From **pushing** the products onto the market to the customers/users **pulling** the goods they need, in the amount and at the time they need.
- It is not only a production system but also a management system.

## A comment on this book

- **Push** method
  - Planned production quantity is determined by demand predictions and inventory on hand
- **Pull** method:
  - The final process withdraws the required quantities from the preceding process a certain time, and this procedure is repeated in reverse order up through all the earlier process.
- **TPS is a pull method**
- **Kanban** are instructions enclosed in clear plastic that at a glance communicate information needed at the work station.

## Starting from Need

- The oil crisis in the fall of 1973, followed by a recession.
- A business could not be profitable using the conventional American mass production system that had worked so well for so long.
- Our problem was how to **cut costs** while producing **small numbers** of **many types of cars**.
- In today's slow-growth era, we must downplay the merits of mass production as soon as possible.
- They needed to catch up with America (WTF).
- Very difficult to raise productivity iby 8 or 9 in such a time period. BUT waste could be eliminated, raising productivity by a factor of ten.
  - This idea marked the start of the present TPS.
- The two pillar needed to support the absolute elimination of waste:
  - Just-in-time
  - **Automation** with a human touch: _autonomation_
- **JIT**
  - Approach zero inventory: the parts needed in an assembly reach the assembly line at the time they are needed an only in the amount needed.
  - To achieve that, in a complex process with hundreds of parts does not fit well with conventional management methods.
- **Kanban**: sign board. Circulate it between each of the processes to control the amount of production (the amount needed).
  - The flow of production is the transfer of materials.
  - The method for transferring the materials is reversed.
  - Every link in the JIT chain is connected and synchronized.
  - Kanban is the means used for conveying information about picking up or receiving the production order.
  - The kanban method is the means by which the TPS moves smoothly.
- Minimize the defects
  - Autonomous automation (automatic stopping device)
    - The machine does not needed any human unless it stops working. That way, one worker can attend several machines.
  - **baka-yoke** (aka 'foolproofing')
    - https://kanbanize.com/lean-management/improvement/what-is-poka-yoke
    - a process step to prevent incorrect operation.
  - Zero quality control
- Stopping the machine when there is trouble forces awareness on everyone.
- **Autonomation**: autonomy + automation
- Efficiency = cost reduction.
- One person for several machines AND also for different **types** of machines.
  - In USA, operators were single-skilled: under such conditions, mass production is the only answer (which implies lots of waste).
- The TPS began when Ohno challenged the old system
  - Experiment: arranging machines in a different way
  - Establishing a production flow
  - Craftspeople needed to function as multi-skilled operators: they didn't like it.
  - He decided not to push people and be patient.
- Production leveling:
  - Establish a production flow
  - Maintain a constant supply of raw materials from outside.
  - "We wanted to get away from having to produce everything around the end of the month": big bang deployments!
  - They asked their outsider suppliers to cooperate in helping them achieve leveled production.
- "Necessity is the mother of invention"
- "One operator, many processes":
  - possible in Japan because they lacked function oriented unions.
  - much of the difference lies in history and culture.
- A revolution in consciousness is indispensable
  - From farming society (huge inventory, more secure) to modern society.
  - In a period of slow growth, holding a large inventory causes the waste of overproduction.

## Evolution of the TPS

- Repeating **Why** five times.
- TPS was built on the practice and evolution of this **scientific approach**
- "We are asking why people work".
- **Wastes**
  - Waste of overproduction.
  - Waste of time on hand (waiting).
  - Waste in transportation.
  - Waste of processing itself.
  - Waste of stock on hand (inventory).
  - Waste of movement.
  - Waste of making defective products.
- Plant-first principle
- Write the standard work sheet yourself
  - Visual control is thoroughly established.
  - The **andon**: the line stop indication board
- **Work combination**
  - The standard work sheet combining materials, workers and machines to produce efficiently.
  - The three elements of the standard work procedure
    - Cycle time
      - The time allotted to make one pice or unit.
      - Cycle time = (Operating hours)/(Quantity required per day)
    - Work sequence
      - The sequence of operations
    - Standard inventory
      - The minimum intra-process work-in-process needed for operations to proceed.
- "Time is the shadow of motion": delay is generated by differences in operator motion and sequence.
  - The field supervisor must train workers
- Teamwork is everything.
  - "The idea is teamwork: not how many parts were machined or drilled by one worker, but how many products were completed by the line as a whole"
  - Work and sports have many things in common.
  - Boat rowed by eight people: the best way to propel the boat faster is for everyone to distribute force equally, rowing evenly and at the same depth.
  - A volleyball team with more than6 players might be injured bumping into one another: having more players is not necessarily an advantage.
  - Teamwork combined with other factors can allow a smaller team to win.
- The skill of passing the baton
  - If the baton is passed well, the total final time can be better than the individual times of the four runners.
  - The parts should be handed over as if they were batons. If an operator in a later process is delayed, others should help set up his or her machine. When the work area returns to normal, that worker should get the baton and everyone else should return to their positions.
  - "I always tell workers they should be skillful in baton passing"
  - The baton-passing system at Toyota: "Mutual Assistance Campaign".
  - "The most important point in common between sports and work is the continuing need for practice and training. It is easy to understand theory with the mind; the problem is to remember it with the body."
- An idea from the US supermarket
  - Learnings about the setup of supermarkets in USA.
    - The biggest problem with this system was how to avoid throwing the earlier process into confusion when a later process picked up large quantities at a time (e.g. a customer which buys lots of items)
- What is Kanban?
  - The operating method of the TPS is kanban.
  - Its most frequently used form is a piece of paper contained in a rectangular vinyl envelope
  - The piece of paper carries:
    - pickup information
    - transfer information
    - production information
  - The supermarket system was adopted in the machine shop around 1953.
  - They used pieces of paper listing the part number of a piece and other information related to machining work: the **kanban**.
  - **Kanban system**
  - In the TPS, overproduction is completely prevented by kanban. As a result, there is no need for extra inventory, its warehouse and its manager.
- Incorrect use causes problems
  - With a better tool, we can get wonderful results. But if use it incorrectly, the tool can make things worse.
  - **Kanban's purpose is just-in-time**
  - Another goal of kanban is eliminating waste
  - Kanban controls the flow of goods at Toyota.
  - It is practiced under strict rules.
  - Functions of kanban
    - Provides pick-up or transport information
    - provides production information
    - prevents overproduction and excessive transport
    - serves as a work order attached to goods
    - prevents defective products by identifying the process making the defectives
    - reveals existing problems and maintains inventory control
- The talent and courage to rethink what we call common sense
  - The first rule of kanban: the later process goes to the earlier process to pick up products
  - Make only the items withdrawn
  - Management commitment and strong support are essential to the successful application of this first rule
  - Production workers have a good deal of psychological resistance to the idea that simply producing as much as possible is no longer a priority.
  - JIT: if used for picking up parts ordered from outside without first changing the production method within the company, kanban immediately becomes a dangerous weapon.
