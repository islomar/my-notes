## Module 1: welcome to the product discovery certification course

- ~ 80% of features shipped by software companies are rarely or never used
- From our customers, we need to understand:
  - What they do
    - Users' behavior inside your application. What features do they adopt? How do they complete tasks?
  - How they feel
    - Users' sentiment based on their experience with your software
  - What they want
    - Users' feedback and specific feature requests that help inform what you build and what you improve.
- Understanding the impact of a possible solution
    - What gets better if this solution works?
    - How many customers will benefit from this product or feature?
    - How will that directly impact my bottom line?
