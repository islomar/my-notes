## My notes

- Book "Basic: advanced topics"
- Pair programming: 1998-1999... real teamwork
- TDD + pairing: the most valuable practices
- Either
  - Find a great place to work (XP-aligned): extremely difficult
  - Try to help things better: it's really hard to convince anybody
- How can I help others to start thinking in a "different" way?
  - Too much queueing, TDD...
  - A lot of work fixing bugs
- Deming: most managers have been taught how to manage in a way that is no longer useful.
- Cynefin framework
- A wicked problem: we will not **discover** the problem until we start solving it...
  - This is the space of SW development
- TBD
- "So much of what we call management consists in making it difficult for people to work." (Peter Drucker)
- "When managers can not measure what they want, they start wanting what they can measure"
  - We use proxy measurements
- Cycle team is only useful in highly repetitive tasks
- Book "A Little Book of F-Laws: 13 Common Sins of Management"
  - <https://www.agileleanhouse.com/lib/lib/People/RussellLAckoff/ALittleBookOfF_Laws.pdf>
- Context switching, distractions, multi-tasking and workflow interruptions
- [Tesler's Law](https://lawsofux.com/teslers-law/)
  - The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.
  - "All processes have a core of complexity that cannot be designed away and therefore must be assumed by either the system or the user"
  - The Design of Everyday Things
    - Users shouldn't be need to be trained to do something
