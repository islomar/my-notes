  - Try to help things better: it's really hard to convince anybody
- How can I help others to start thinking in a "different" way?
  - Too much queueing, TDD...
  - A lot of work fixing bugs
- Deming: most managers have been taught how to manage in a way that is no longer useful.
- Cynefin framework
- A wicked problem: we will not **discover** the problem until we start solving it...
  - This is the space of SW development
- TBD
- "So much of what we call management consists in making it difficult for people to work." (Peter Drucker)

    - Users shouldn't be need to be trained to do something
- Daily meeting asking "Is there anyone blocked or any blocker?" is a smell for lack of real-time communication.
