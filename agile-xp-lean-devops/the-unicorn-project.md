- Horizon 1 - Company’s cash-cow.
- Horizon 2 - High growth. Next cash-cows.
- Horizon 3 - Pool of ideas to explore. Need to find asap:
  - Market risks: does the idea solve a real customer need?
  - Technical risk: Is it technically feasible?
  - Business model risk: Is there a financially feasible engine of growth?
- Other ideas about it:
  - Horizon 1: Take care of the current business, generating money out of the product today.
  - Horizon 2: Take care of where money will come from in one to three years, generating future - growth.
  - Horizon 3: Work on visions and options to grow beyond that time, capturing options for future growth.
- More ideas:
  - Horizon 1: mature businesses
  - Horizon 2: rapidly growing businesses
  - Horizon 3: emerging businesses
- Horizon 1 needs:
  - Consistency.
  - Compliance.
  - Bureaucracy.
  - Rules.
- Horizon 3 needs:
  - Speed.
  - Experimentation.
  - Fast feedback.

## Core vs Context

- Core: what the customer is paying for.
- Context: everything else. What is needed for operate (cafeteria, HR, email, …).
- Context is a burden.
- Invest in Core, outsource Context.
