### Tactical Design

- Model-Driven Design
  - Map from our business/context, model it to our application. Drive the design based in the already existing model. Expressed in Services.
- Services
  - Application Services
  - Domain Services
  - Infrastructure Services
- Repositories
  - Data mapper perspective instead of Active Record
- Factories
  - Aggregates can be encapsulated in Factories
- Entities
  - It has an id
  - Integrity maintained by Aggregates
- Value Objects
  - It is represented by the value contained, not by an id (e.g. colours)
  - Encapsulated with Aggregates
- Aggregates
  - There is an Aggregate root.
  - It offers encapsulation to deal with Entities/VO
  - The repositories should work with Aggregates as a whole unit (for keeping integrity as well)
  - Accessed with Repositories
- Domain Events
  - Entities publish a domain event each time an Entity changes its state
- Layered Architecture

### Strategic Design

- Ubiquitous Language
- Bounded Context
  - A "same thing" could be managed in a different way in different contexts. E.g. a "video" or a "user" can be different.
  - You can have several bounded contexts in a monorepo or several repos, and even in several languages.
- Big Ball of Mud
- Anticorruption Layer
  - Any mechanism to decouple/isolate
- Context Map
  - Map all the "real" concepts to the DDD concepts.
  - It's something logic, not physical.
- Separate Ways
  - Context maps free teams to separate ways: each team working for example with different languages.
- Customer/Supplier Teams
- Continuous Integration
- Shared Kernel
  - Things that we can share. It could be between contexts (but it should be really light and small, e.g. the Value object for userId, base Entity, etc.)
- Conformist
- Open Host Service
  - To communicate with me, here you have my API (support multiple clients)
- Published Language
- Conformist
  - E.g. two teams with different contexts. If I want to consume your service, I have to adapt to your API.

## DDD at Scale: using Domain Driven Design to build client centric products
- https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Software-Crafters-North/events/284995312/
- Bob Gregory (Engineering Coach at Cazoo)
- "Business-Driven Design"
- We need to constantly evolve our models.
- The actual domain model is the **shared understanding**. That's more valuable than the diagrams or the code.
- DDD shines when modelling a complex problem. Not to apply if:
  - Things are very simple. CRUD without business logic, static website, etc. There is no business model to articulate. Something really data-centric.
  - ML: it's a black box (by design), you do not understand the rules. You can not build a shared understanding with the computer.
- Trying to understand how are customers understand the problem.
- **Aggregate**: course-grained consistency boundary.
  - Order, order lines, delivery address.
  - Whenever we save, we save the whole Order.
  - If you get performance problems for saving it (e.g. because of having thousands of order lines). You can wonder if you really need consistency in all the thousands of order lines.
- **Bounded context**:
  - a linguistic boundary
  - every term we use has single concrete definition
  - in another context, the term could have a different meaning (e.g. "order" is different for a customer, for sales, logistics, etc.)
  - the problem space can be huge, we cut in small chunks... Avoid being overwhelmed by complexity. Cognitive load.
  - Small enough that we can hold it in our head.
  - A bounded context might be a good fit for a microservice. What business process does this microservice cover?
