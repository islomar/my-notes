## Introduction

- The transformer architecture revolutionized generative AI. In fact, the "GPT" in ChatGPT stands for "Generative Pre-Trained Transformer."
- Originally introduced in the groundbreaking 2017 paper **Attention Is All You Need**, by Ashish Vaswani and others, transformers were a highly scalable model for machine translation tasks. Variants of this architecture now power todayâ€™s LLMs such as those from OpenAI, Google, Meta, Cohere, and Anthropic.

## Understanding Language Models: Language as a Bag-of-Words

![](How-Transformer-LLMs-Work-Anthropic-course/recent-history-of-language-ai.png)

- Tokenization: process of converting words into pieces
- Vocabulary: all unique words of tokens contained in several documents
  - vocabulary size: number of tokens
  - you can count how often a token appears
- Bag-of-Words:
  - numerical representation of a text, taking into account the appearance and absence of its tokens in a **Vocabulary**.
  - the order is important, it allows to compare texts.
  - usually the vector representation numbers do not have a direct meaning: vector embeddings.

## Understanding Language Models: (Word) Embeddings

- **Bag-of-Words** does not consider the semantic nature of text
- **Word2Vec** could capture meaning of words in vector embeddings through _neural networks

- Weights = parameters of the model
- Word2Vec **learning process**:
  - Using these neural networks, Word2Vec generates word embeddings by looking at which other words they tend to appear next to in a given sentence. You start by assigning every word in your vocabulary with a **vector embedding**, say, five values for each word is initialized with random values.
  - Then in every training step, you take pairs of words from training data, and the model attempts to predict whether or not they are likely to be neighbors in a sentence.
  - During this training process, Word2Vec learns the relationship between words and distills that information into the embedding.
  - If the two words tend to have the same neighbor, their embeddings will be closer to one another and vice versa.
  - The resulting embeddings capture the **meaning** of words.
- **Embeddings attempt to capture meaning by representing the properties of words/tokens**.
  - The number of values or properties that an embedding has is called **number of dimensions** (usually a fixed size, it can be very large)
  - You can use these values to get a proxy of the meaning of these words.
  - In practice, you don't really know what those properties represent, they are done through complex math calculations.
  - You can compare embeddings: how similar o dissimilar each embedding are depends on the training data.

- There are several **types of embeddings**
  - Word2Vec is a **Representation Model**: it attempts to represent the text as values.
- An embedding is generated for each token.
- You can average the embeddings and get "word embeddings", "sentence embeddings", or "document embeddings".
