### Ideas
- Sociotechnical systems
- **Loops**
    - Reinforcing loops:
        - They are self-enhancing, leading to exponential growth or to runaway collapses over time
        - "Positive feedback loop"
        - Virtuous or vicious loops
    - Balancing loops / inhabiting loops
        - It opposes whatever direction of change is imposed on the system
- **Delays** in feedback is a problem
- **Hierarchy** - self-organizing system often generate hierarchy
- **Resiliency** and stability
    - A diverse system is more stable and less vulnerable to external shock than uniform system with little diversity
    - Fault tolerance
- Beware the incentives. Addictions.
- Behavior-based models are more useful than event-based ones
    - System fools us by presenting themselves as a series of events
- **System traps**: perverse patterns
    - The tragedy of the commons
    - Drift to low performance
    - Escalation
    - Success to the Successful
    - Shifting the Burden to the intervenor
    - Rule beating
    - Seeking the wrong goal
- **Guidelines** for living in a world of systems
    1. Get the beat of the system
    2. Expose your mental models to the light of day.
    3. Honor, respect, and distribute information.
    4. Use language with care and enrich it with systems conceps
    5. Pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable.
    6. Make feedback policies for feedback systems.
    7. Go for the good of the whole
- **Leverage points**: places to intervene a system
    - https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system
    - These are places within a complex system (a corporation, an economy, a living body, a city, an ecosystem) where a small shift in one thing can produce big changes in everything.
    - In increasing order of effectiveness:
    
        12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards).
        11. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows.
        10. The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures).
        9. The lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system change.
        8. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against.
        7. The gain around driving positive feedback loops.
        6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).
        5. The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints).
        4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.
        3. The goals of the system.
        2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises.
        1. The power to transcend paradigms.
- Quotes
    - https://twitter.com/search?q=(%22Thinking%20In%20Systems%22)%20(from%3Aislomar)&src=typed_query&f=top
    - "Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a **model**."
    - To be a **highly functional system**, hierarchy must balance the welfare, freedom, and responsibilities of the subsystems and total system - there must be enough central control to achieve coordination toward the large-system goal, and enough autonomy to keep all subsystems flourishing, functioning, and self-organizing"
    - "The **future** can't be predicted, but it can be envisioned and brought lovingly into being. Systems can't be controlled, but they can be designed and redesigned."
    - "The original purpose of a **hierarchy** is always to help is originating subsystems do their jobs better. This is something, unfortunately, that both the higher and the lower levels of a greatly articulated hierarchy easily can forget"
    - "Here is a system that seems perverse on all counts. It produces inefficiency, ugliness, environmental degradation, and human misery. But if we seep it away, we will have no system. Nothing is more frightening than that".
    - "The thing to do, when you don't know, is not to bluff and not to freeze, but to **learn**. [...] What's appropriate when you're learning is **small steps**, **constant monitoring**, and a willingness to change course as you find out more about where it's leading."
    - "Interdisciplinary communication works only if there is a real problem to be solved, and if the representatives from the various disciplines are more committed to solving the problem than to being academically correct. They will have to go into learning mode. They will have to admit ignorance and be willing to be taught, by each other and by the system. It can be done. It's very exciting when it happens".
