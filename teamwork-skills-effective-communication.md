    - [How Management Teams Can Have a Good Fight](https://www.womeninanesthesiology.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/HBR-how-management-teams-can-have-a-good-fight.pdf)
        - Lack of conflict isn't harmony... it's apathy
        - Conflict can be good for groups, it means we are engaged, surfacing differences, challenging decisions, exposing patterns, refining ideas.
        - Don't eliminate conflict... mange conflict and respond more appropriately.
        - Successful teams keep conflict **constructive** and focused on the **issues**
        - Successful teams employ **six tactics** related to communication:
            - They work with more information and debate on the basis of **facts** (not personalities)
            - They develop multiple **alternatives**
            - They have commonly **agreed-upon goals**
            - They inject **humor** into their deliberations
            - They maintain a **balanced power structure**: establish a sense of fairness and equity in the process.
            - They resolve issues **without forcing consensus**
- **Choosing the Right Words**
    - Language **constructs** our social worlds. It creates reality.
    - Meaning, interpretation and understanding.
    - Ask the right questions and identify the key principles to choose the right words.
    - We move in the realm of probability, not of certainty or chance.
    - Questions to ask in a conflict situation to put us in a better mindset:
        - What do I want to **say** vs what do I want to **accomplish**?
        - What are we **making** together, and how could I **frame** things differently?
        - Does this need to be **said**... **by me**... **right now**?
        - What is this conflict **really about**?
        - What **question** can I ask in this conflict situation, instead of what **statement** can I make?
            - Can you help me understand?
            - Can you explain more about?
            - Can you clarify why?
            - Asking questions is more invitational than adversarial.
            - Asking questions is different to questioning
        - How can I be **reflexive** in this conflict situation?
            - The common denominator in your dysfunctional relationships... is YOU!
- **Basics of effective negotiation**
    - Positional bargaining : saving face and protecting their reputation
    - Effective negotiation should strive to create value for all of the individuals involved in the decision.
    - Book ["Getting to yes: Negotiating agreement without giving in"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313605.Getting_to_Yes)
    - 4 key concepts we need to consider in any negotiation:
        - Problems
            - Separate the problem from the **people**
            - "okay, it might seem like I'm being attacked personally, but this issue really is about some other problem beyond me. I'm going to stay focused on that."
            - Let's keep the conversation focused on the problem we're trying to solve, not the people involved.
        - Interests:
            - Focused on **interests**, not **positions**
            - Story of two chefs and the orange.
        - Options
            - We need to create **multiple options** for **mutual gains**
        - Standards
            - Insist that the **results** of a negotiation be based on an **objective standard**
    - We should always keep in mind our **BATNA**: Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement
        - What is at stake if you don't reach an agreement?
        - If you don't have a good alternative apart from negotiating, you need to reach an agreement, and probably have to be willing to accept some concessions.
    - What if someone plays dirty tricks during the negotiation?
        - Recognize the tactic
        - Raise the issue explicitly
        - Question whether or not that tactic is legitimate or desirable
        - "Negotiation Jiu Jitsu"
- **Diversity Matters**
    - Difference and diversity are all about understanding and appreciating the unique characteristics that each member brings to the group.
    - Most of us feel comfortable being around people who are similar to not different from us.
    - Different people bring different perspectives and ideas to group work.
    - It's usually difficult to talk about...
    - Book ["Difference matters"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24033326-difference-matters)
    - The issues or categories or difference that are significant, e.g. gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, physical ability, politics, religion, age and social class.
    - Difference matters because it is important:
        - **Factual**: it is a basic **demographic fact** of modern society
        - **Strategic**: difference brings **strategic advantages** to our groups
            - [Video from Starbucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc-M5cMKQCk): "Diversity is about who we are. Inclusion is about what we do".
        - **Moral**: growing **moral imperative** to include those who have been historically marginalized
            - Diversity will not happen without intention and initiative.
            - Not enough to say "I'm not racist", we have think systemics.
- **Understanding Identity**
    - Who we are as a group. It has a lot of influence on how we interact with each other, depending on how we see ourselves, how we see other people and how the group see itself as a collective.
    - Identity is not fixed but a social construct that people create, maintain and alter through our interactions.
    - Better to think about **social identity**.
    - Identity is a **relational property**.
    - **Essentialism**: the belief that social characteristics are **inherent** or essential to one's identity. Dangerous, it equates behavior=character
    - We tend to identify ourself with our profession, hobbies, etc. Usually we focus on the "social aspects" of our identity.
    - A category only make sense because there exist other categories.
    - **Fundamental attribution error**: mistake of attributing behavior to personal character rather than broader situational factors. We do the opposite for ourselves.
    - **How we make sense of the actions of other people**
        - Focus on **situational factors**, not on an "essential character".
        - We need to take mental shortcuts. The temptation is to take the identity as an heuristic.
        - Essentialism constrains the possibilities of our communication.
        - Instead, consider the situational factors that influence people's actions.
    - **How we manage our own identities**
        - Communication helps construct a robust, complex identity.
        - Presenting a **monolithic identity** makes it easier for others to discard or marginalize your ideas. Instead, tell others what **"hat"** you're wearing in your discussions.
    - **Relational identity base on interaction**.
    - **Collective identity**: distinct personality that transcends any individual group member. The WE-ness of the group.
- **Communication and Gender**
    - "Men are from Mars, women are from Venus" :-(
    - Men and women are actually similar in their communication behavior
        - Book "The myth of Mars and Venus", by Deborah Cameron
        - Paper: "The gender similarities hypothesis" by Janet Shibley Hyde
    - Differences are better explained in terms of socialization
    - Culture socializes us into different roles, norms, and expectations
    - **Linguistic style**: characteristic patterns of speech. It differs between men and women. It is more a result of socialization than genetics.
    - Article: "The power of talk" by Deborah Tannen
        - Communication is fundamentally **ritual**: rapport vs status (for children, girls vs boys)
    - Our interpretation of interactions are likely to be gendered

4. Week 4: Group Communication & Technology
- Framework for thinking critically about technology in the context of communication.
- Virtual work
    - Technology is never neutral: it impacts how we interact to each other.
    - Technology can not completely replace things.
    - Article "The third wave of virtual work" by Tammy Johns and Lynda Gratton
        - 3 waves of virtual work:
            - First wave: 80s, data through the phone line. Virtual freelancers. Graphic design, report writing, etc. No connections to a gormal organization.
            - Second wave: virtual corporate colleagues. Full-time employees who work remotely most of the time. 90s and early 2000s. Compromised conventional workplace benefits (informal conversations, face to face).
            - Third wave: virtual coworkers. Regular times of colocation. Coworking spaces.
