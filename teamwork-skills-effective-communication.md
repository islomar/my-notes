    - [How Management Teams Can Have a Good Fight](https://www.womeninanesthesiology.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/HBR-how-management-teams-can-have-a-good-fight.pdf)
        - Lack of conflict isn't harmony... it's apathy
        - Conflict can be good for groups, it means we are engaged, surfacing differences, challenging decisions, exposing patterns, refining ideas.
        - Don't eliminate conflict... mange conflict and respond more appropriately.
        - Successful teams keep conflict **constructive** and focused on the **issues**
        - Successful teams employ **six tactics** related to communication:
            - They work with more information and debate on the basis of **facts** (not personalities)
            - They develop multiple **alternatives**
            - They have commonly **agreed-upon goals**
            - They inject **humor** into their deliberations
            - They maintain a **balanced power structure**: establish a sense of fairness and equity in the process.
            - They resolve issues **without forcing consensus**
- **Choosing the Right Words**
    - Language **constructs** our social worlds. It creates reality.
    - Meaning, interpretation and understanding.
    - Ask the right questions and identify the key principles to choose the right words.
    - We move in the realm of probability, not of certainty or chance.
    - Questions to ask in a conflict situation to put us in a better mindset:
        - What do I want to **say** vs what do I want to **accomplish**?
        - What are we **making** together, and how could I **frame** things differently?
        - Does this need to be **said**... **by me**... **right now**?
        - What is this conflict **really about**?
        - What **question** can I ask in this conflict situation, instead of what **statement** can I make?
            - Can you help me understand?
            - Can you explain more about?
            - Can you clarify why?
            - Asking questions is more invitational than adversarial.
            - Asking questions is different to questioning
        - How can I be **reflexive** in this conflict situation?
            - The common denominator in your dysfunctional relationships... is YOU!
- **Basics of effective negotiation**
    - Positional bargaining : saving face and protecting their reputation
    - Effective negotiation should strive to create value for all of the individuals involved in the decision.
    - Book ["Getting to yes: Negotiating agreement without giving in"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313605.Getting_to_Yes)
    - 4 key concepts we need to consider in any negotiation:
        - Problems
            - Separate the problem from the **people**
            - "okay, it might seem like I'm being attacked personally, but this issue really is about some other problem beyond me. I'm going to stay focused on that."
            - Let's keep the conversation focused on the problem we're trying to solve, not the people involved.
        - Interests:
            - Focused on **interests**, not **positions**
            - Story of two chefs and the orange.
        - Options
            - We need to create **multiple options** for **mutual gains**
        - Standards
            - Insist that the **results** of a negotiation be based on an **objective standard**
    - We should always keep in mind our **BATNA**: Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement
        - What is at stake if you don't reach an agreement?
        - If you don't have a good alternative apart from negotiating, you need to reach an agreement, and probably have to be willing to accept some concessions.
    - What if someone plays dirty tricks during the negotiation?
        - Recognize the tactic
        - Raise the issue explicitly
        - Question whether or not that tactic is legitimate or desirable
        - "Negotiation Jiu Jitsu"
- **Diversity Matters**
    - Difference and diversity are all about understanding and appreciating the unique characteristics that each member brings to the group.
    - Most of us feel comfortable being around people who are similar to not different from us.
    - Different people bring different perspectives and ideas to group work.
    - It's usually difficult to talk about...
    - Book ["Difference matters"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24033326-difference-matters)
    - The issues or categories or difference that are significant, e.g. gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, physical ability, politics, religion, age and social class.
    - Difference matters because it is important:
        - **Factual**: it is a basic **demographic fact** of modern society
        - **Strategic**: difference brings **strategic advantages** to our groups
            - [Video from Starbucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc-M5cMKQCk): "Diversity is about who we are. Inclusion is about what we do".
        - **Moral**: growing **moral imperative** to include those who have been historically marginalized
            - Diversity will not happen without intention and initiative.
            - Not enough to say "I'm not racist", we have think systemics.
- **Understanding Identity**
    - Who we are as a group. How we interact with each other, depending on how we see ourselves, how we see other people and how the group see itself as a collective.
    - Identity is not fixed but a social construct that people create, maintain and alter through our interactions.
    - Better to think about **social identity**.
    - Identity is a **relational property**.
    - **Essentialism**: the belief that social characteristics are **inherent** or essential to one's identity.
