Vijami:

- coding is 20% of the time
- we don't hire "backend engineers"
- Continuous Delivery
- "I don't like estimations"
- Building
- Fast feedback loops

Attitude

También hablaron de vertical slicing, limiting WIP, etc.

Not talking about technologies, but the discussions. What you have built.
Proud of what you built...
Focus on the product, what you built in the past.
Embrace change, stay optimistic.

Hire for attitude, not for tech.

Luis Soares: they do pairing by default. Mention to XP. They do a lot of TDD and pairing. TBD, no branches. "Focus your energy on impact, not on tools". Experimentation culture. "Don't estimate". It's about splitting as much as possible.
