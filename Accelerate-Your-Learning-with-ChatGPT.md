## Module 1: GenAI Landscape and Neural Networks — Parallels in Machine and Human Learning

- "AI won't replace humans, but humans who use AI will replace humans that don't." (Fei Fei Li, Stanford professor, AI researcher)
- ChatGPT:
  - predicting the next word in a sentence.
  - it relates words in sentences to one another

  - [Suno: make a song about anything](https://suno.com/)
  - It introduced the idea of the **Transformer**, which has two main components in it:
    - The encoder: where we take in the information, e.g. the prompt
    - The decoder: which spits out the ouput
- **Translation**: an act, process, or instance of translating; such as:
  - a rendering from one language into another
  - a change to a different substance, form, or appearance: **conversion**
- **AI meets metaphor: learning is linking**
  - How the brain learns
  - Neurons, axons, dendritic spines...
  - Neurons send signals
  - When you learn, you're making new connections between neurons.
  - The more you practice something, the stronger those connections become.
  - You need to restudy the materials and "learn well". You need to practice.
  - Metaphor is incredibly valuable in learning.
  - Tool used by many great professors: **metaphors and analogies**
    - But metaphors always break down...
  - How to we come up with metaphors?
    - We can use generative AI!!!
    - We can ask for several metaphors
- **Translating Concepts to Metaphors & Analogies**
  - **The Metaphor Pattern**
    - we want to get the model to explain things to us using metaphors and analogies that we understand well.
    - Pattern: "Explain some topic using metaphors and analogies. [Here what you want to learn about]"
    - E.g.: "Explain why we should learn about generative AI, even though the models are changing so rapidly. Use a car and engine analogy."
    - E.g. with less direction: "Whenever you explain things to me, relate it to analogies and metaphors that I will understand. I know a lot about cars. Explain why we should learn about generative AI, even though the models are changing so rapidly."
- **Helping the Large Language Model Select Metaphors & Analogies**
  - Example **Audience Persona Pattern**:

  ```Plain text
  About me:
  ---------
  I'm a professor of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. I'm the senior advisor, I have a typo to the Chancellor in Generative AI and Enterprise and Education. I love the mountain bike and ride BMX bikes. I like cooking and healthy eating. Even if I'm not that great at being disciplined with my eating, I like to understand the science behind nutrition.
  ---------
  Explain how the transformer model works using analogies and metaphors that will resonate with me.
