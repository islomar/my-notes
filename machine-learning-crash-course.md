- [NumPy Ultraquick Tutorial Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/eng-edu/blob/main/ml/cc/exercises/numpy_ultraquick_tutorial.ipynb?hl=en)
    - **Numpy** is a Python library for creating and manipulating matrices, the main data structure used by ML algorithms. Matrices are mathematical objects used to store values in rows and columns.
    - Python calls matrices lists, NumPy calls them arrays and TensorFlow calls them tensors. Python represents matrices with the list data type.
    - Broadcasting: Expanding the shape of an operand in a matrix math operation to dimensions compatible for that operation.

    - A **DataFrame** is similar to an in-memory spreadsheet. Like a spreadsheet:
        - A DataFrame stores data in cells.
        - A DataFrame has named columns (usually) and numbered rows.
