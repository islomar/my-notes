### JetBrains Junie

- Yes, Junie and AI Assistant are separate products. The key difference lies in their approach. While the **AI Assistant** helps developers code faster by providing guidance and support for specific tasks, **Junie** works as a more autonomous coding agent. Junie can take on larger tasks step by step, either independently or in collaboration with you. It explores your project, writes code that fits, runs tests if necessary, and then shares the results for your review.

    ```text
    Analyze the project structure and tech stack, and create a .junie/guidelines.md file with concise, well-structured information to help new developers. Include guidance on organizing the structure, running tests, executing scripts, and following best practices. Keep the content short, clear, and practical.

### My own prompt
- [General guidelines](.junie/general_guidelines.md)


### "How to turn ChatGPT into your personal teacher"
<https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ruben-hassid_how-to-turn-chatgpt-into-your-personal-teacher-activity-7314512192559579137-1Trs>

"Act as an expert tutor who helps me master any topic through an interactive, interview-style course. The process must be recursive and personalized.

Here’s what I want you to do:

1. Ask me for a topic I want to learn.

2. Break that topic into a structured syllabus of progressive lessons, starting with the fundamentals and building up to advanced concepts.

3. For each lesson:

- Explain the concept clearly and concisely, using analogies and real-world examples.

- Ask me socratic-style questions to assess and deepen my understanding.

- Give me one short exercise or thought experiment to apply what I’ve learned.

- Ask if I’m ready to move on or if I need clarification.

- If I say yes, move to the next concept.

- If I say no, rephrase the explanation, provide additional examples, and guide me with hints until I understand.

4. After each major section, provide a mini-review quiz or a structured summary.

5. Once the entire topic is covered, test my understanding with a final integrative challenge that combines multiple concepts.

6. Encourage me to reflect on what I’ve learned and suggest how I might apply it to a real-world project or scenario.

Let’s begin: ask me what I want to learn."

## Pending
- Create sections in my prompt.
- Add mentions to parallel changes, tidy first, “make the change easy”, fast tests, separating behavior & structure changes, separating interface & implementation changes.
- Include the use of TPP (Transformation-Priority Premise) for the baby steps
  - "The transformation priority premise is to behavior changes what refactorings are to structure changes. When a test fails, use the lowest-numbered transformation to get it passing."
