## Summary
We often talk to be heard, but what if we stopped debating to win and started listening to understand, discovering meaning together instead?
Join us for a FREE interactive exploration of “Dialogue and the Art of Thinking Together,” inspired by William Isaacs’ groundbreaking work on how groups can reach shared understanding.

This won’t be a presentation, it will be a facilitated conversation and practice session. We’ll explore what makes dialogue different from discussion or debate, how assumptions shape what we hear and say, and how we can build the conditions that allow genuine thinking together to emerge.

Most of our conversations are competitions in disguise. We listen to respond, not to understand. We defend positions instead of exploring possibilities. We call this "discussion" and wonder why we feel exhausted, misunderstood, and stuck.

We’re looking for curious minds who want to experiment with listening more deeply, suspending judgment, and discovering what becomes possible when we stop trying to win an argument and start exploring meaning together. Whether you’re leading teams, collaborating on complex problems, or simply drawn to better ways of connecting, this session is for you.
