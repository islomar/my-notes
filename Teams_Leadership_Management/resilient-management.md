## Introduction
There are lots of skills needed to lead successful teams. This book focuses on half of them: the human growth and resiliency skills.

## Chapter 1. Meet your team
- A team that’s shipping, is highly motivated, and collaborates and disagrees *productively*.
- Paloma Medina organizes core needs in the workplace to create the acronym [BICEPS](https://www.palomamedina.com/biceps/)
    - Belonging
    - Improvement/Progress
    - Choice
    - Equality/Fairness
    - Predictability
    - Significance
- [Questions for our first 1:1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ALVJFA8gp7H53iIyPQqoBN1IvZku-5YYcjKpMx6HCXE/edit)
- Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?
- Every one of us carries a distinct approach to working and leading that often feels hard to identify or name, because we’re living in it all day long.
- When managers share their approach to management with their teammates, it can create an opportunity to develop better working relationships.
- You can use a Mad Lib to help guide your reflection around these management values.
    - I’m a _ leader who values _ and __. You’ll see this when I __. I support my team by __ and I stay aligned with company values by __. I thrive in a __ environment. I commit to being __
- Optimize for long-term relationships
- **Coaching questions**:
    - Which core BICEPS need comes up the most often for you?
    - What are your work styles and preferences? What are your own answers to the “First 1:1 Questions”?
    - What do you wish you could optimize for in the day-to-day of your manager role?
    - What kinds of introspection have you avoided doing with your teammates so far? Why?
    - As you introspect about your own needs, preferences, and optimizations, what new realizations could you share with your manager in your next 1:1?


## Chapter 2. Grow your teammates
- To spur this course-correction and growth in your teammates, you’ll end up wearing four different hats:
    - **Mentoring**: lending advice and helping to problem solve based on your own experience.
    - **Coaching**: asking open questions to help your teammate reflect and introspect, rather than sharing your own opinions or quickly problem solving.
    - **Sponsoring**: finding opportunities for your teammate to level up, take on new leadership roles, and get promoted.
    - **Delivering** feedback: observing behavior that is or isn’t aligned to what the team needs to be doing and sharing those observations, along with praise or suggestions.
- If you are not a member of a marginalized group, and you have a mentee who is, please **be a responsible mentor**!
- As mentors, we want our mentees to reach beyond us, because our mentees’ success is ultimately **our** success.
- Managers often default to mentoring mode because it feels like the fastest way to solve a problem, but it falls short in helping your teammate connect their own dots.
- In **coaching mode** —an extremely powerful but often underutilized mode—you’re doing two primary things:
    1. **Asking open questions** to help the other person explore more of the shape of the topic, rather than staying at the surface level.
        - what questions can be authentically curious! When someone comes to you with a challenge, try asking questions like:
            - What’s most important to you about it?
            - What’s holding you back?
            - What does success look like?
        - Rather than telling them what I think is necessary for them **to be promoted**, I could instead open up this conversation by asking them:
            - What would you be able to do in the new level that you can’t do in your current one?
            - What skills are required in the new level? What are some ways that you’ve honed those skills?
            - • Who are the people already at that level that you want to emulate? What about them do you want to emulate?
    2. **Reflecting**, which is like holding up a mirror for the other person and describing what you see or hear, or asking them to reflect for themselves.
- **Coaching** can generate way more growth for that other person than just giving them advice or sharing your perspective.
- A good question to ask might be "Can you help me understand what you’re optimizing for?"
- Ask them “What’s the impact of that?” repeatedly until you get to the nugget of measurable, clear impact of the other person’s behavior.
- Build feedback into your team routines, like retrospectives.
- Managers and individual contributors often aim to accomplish the following in their 1:1s:
    - Build trust
    - Gain shared context
    - Plan out and support career growth
    - Solve problems
- Consider whether or not this teammate might flourish if they moved to a different part of the organization. It’s your responsibility to make sure you’re not “passing a problem around.”
- However, when someone’s behavior is damaging to those around them, or when their behavior is costing the business in some way, switching managers will do more harm than good.
- Lean on your network of support; you don’t need to do this alone.


## Chapter 3. Set clear expectations
- I recommend that you develop clear expectations in collaboration with your team, document them in a searchable, central location (like a wiki), and keep them updated over time as the environment and people change:
    - teammates’ roles and responsibilities, including the manager’s role
    - the team’s vision or priorities
    - how teammates should be collaborating, communicating, and shipping work

## My notes
- Tuckman's model is basically "wrong" and it's the backbone of the book.

- In the "feedback equation" model, emotions are basically removed, which is plain wrong from my point of view.
