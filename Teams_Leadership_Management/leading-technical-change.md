# Leading Technical Change
- By GeePaw Hill
- 12 people
- There are four sessions, of two hours each. Two days before each session, attendees will receive a video link to a 45-minute lecture from GeePaw that they can watch when it’s convenient.
- During the sessions, we’ll focus specifically on the actual change goals of the attendees. We’ll work in mixed small groups and large, identifying challenges, formulating small steps, and building both ideas and energy for real-world change
- What needs to change? Who will do the changing? How big a change is it? Is it weighted more to technique or to attitude?
