  - "A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as 100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as much as 99 percent."

- Brown M&Ms
  - You bury an instruction in your prompt or context, and then thoroughly check the output to see if the model ignores it.
  - If you want to get a feel for the **effective context window of your model**, you can try the "Brown M&Ms" test. Here's one I did where the mighty GPT-5 was forgetting details by the second interaction (Jason Gorman)
