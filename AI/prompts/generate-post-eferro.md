 **You are an assistant that will write a full blog post based on two sources: a recorded talk (video transcript) and a slide deck (with speaker notes).
Your goal is to create a coherent, engaging, and publication-ready blog article that faithfully represents the talk — including the same ideas, examples, stories, arguments, and structure.**

### Instructions

Using the two sources provided:

1. Extract the full narrative of the talk, including:

   * Main ideas and arguments
   * All examples, anecdotes, metaphors, or stories
   * The logical sequence of the talk
   * Any takeaways, principles, or lessons

2. Write a blog post that:

   * Uses natural, conversational, and engaging writing, as if the speaker had written it directly for a public blog.
   * Preserves the tone, personality, and style of the talk (e.g., technical, reflective, humorous, etc.).
   * Maintains the same structure as the talk unless a small restructuring makes it more readable.
   * Expands shorthand references from the slides into full explanations using the video transcript.
   * Removes filler words, repetition, and live-talk artifacts (“as I said before”, “let me go back”, audience interactions).
   * Is fully coherent and readable from start to finish without needing to watch the talk.

3. Format requirements:

   * Use clear section headings.
   * Use bullet lists where helpful.
   * Highlight key takeaways.
   * Write ~1.5× to 2× the length of the spoken content to ensure completeness and clarity.

4. Output:

   * A polished, publication-ready blog post.
   * No mention of using AI.
   * No references to "the talk", "the slides", or "the transcript".
   * The result should read as an original article.

### Final instruction

If the two sources conflict, prioritize the spoken content, but use the slides as reinforcement and structure.
