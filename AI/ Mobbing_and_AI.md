What happens when collaborative programming meets artificial intelligence?

In this session, we’ll explore how mobbing and AI can complement each other to accelerate learning, improve code quality, and strengthen team alignment.

We’ll share real examples of AI-assisted mobbing—from refactors to retros—and discuss what worked, what didn’t, and how to keep humans at the center of collaboration.

Whether you’re curious about ensemble development (Mob Programming / Software Teaming) or experimenting with AI tools, you’ll walk away with practical ways to integrate both without losing the magic of thinking together.

## My notes
- Book "Teaming. How organizations learn, innovate, and compete in the knowledge economy"
- "Stay open-minded about these things"
- "Can we find better ways to interact?"
- Cooperation: helping each other when needed
- You don't need to get along when collaborating or co-creating
- We need to be willing to be wrong
- "Software Teaming": All the brilliant minds working together... on the same thing... at the same time... in the same space... at the same computer...
- Efficiency vs Productivity vs **Effectiveness** --> **take more notes from this!!**
    - We should go after effectiveness
- Inventory is waste
- Let's consider the non-value-added time in any one active step
