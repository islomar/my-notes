## Lesson 1: Why MCP

- MCP was launched by Anthropic in November of 2024.
- Models are only as good as the **context** given to them.
- Open source protocol: it standardizes how AI applications interact with external systems.
- **LSP** ([Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), based on JSON RPC): it standardizes how IDEs interact with language-specific tools.
- MCP servers are reusable by various AI applications.
- MPC servers provide tool schemas plus functions already defined for you.

## Lesson 2: MCP Architecture

- Notifications can be sent both ways.
- MCP Transports
    1. For servers running locally: **stdio**
    2. For remote servers:
        - HTTP+SSE (Server Sent Events)
            - For stateful connections
        - Streamable HTTP
            - It allows both stateful and stateless connections
            - HTTP or SSE
            - It is recommended. By default, it starts with stateless communication.

## Lesson 3: Chatbot example

- <https://s172-29-127-134p8888.lab-aws-production.deeplearning.ai/doc/tree/L3>
- [Guide on how to implement tool use](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview#how-to-implement-tool-use)
- The code is [here](./mcp-course-by-anthropic/L3_Chatbot_Example_MCP_Antrhopic_course.ipynb)

## Lesson 4: Creating an MCP Server

- We will wrap what we did in the last section and wrap it in an MCP server using the standard IO transport.
- We will use FastMCP
- The code is [here](./mcp-course-by-anthropic/L4_Creating_an_MCP_server_Antrhopic_course.ipynb)
- After following the instructions, we run an MCP inspector, accessible at <https://s172-29-127-134p6274.lab-aws-production.deeplearning.ai/#resources>
- Steps:

```bash
cd L4/mcp_project
uv init
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv add mcp arxiv
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run research_server.py
# At the MCP inspector, fill the Proxy Address (unless run locally)
```

- [Advanced usage low-level server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/blob/main/README.md#advanced-usage)
- [MCP inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
  - The MCP inspector is a developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers.

## Lesson 5: Creating an MCP Client


- [Code example](mcp-course-by-anthropic/L5_MCP_Client_Anthropic_course.ipynb)
- In the example, the MCP client starts a local MCP server with `uv run research_server.py`
- The MCP client connects to the MCP server
- The MCP_ChatBot class consists of the methods:
  - `process_query`
  - `chat_loop`
  - `connect_to_server_and_run`
- ... and has the following attributes:
  - session (of type ClientSession)
  - anthropic: Anthropic
  - available_tools
- In `connect_to_server_and_run`, the client launches the server and requests the list of tools that the server provides (through the client session). The tool definitions are stored in the variable available_tools and are passed in to the LLM in `process_query`.

![](mcp-course-by-anthropic/L5_MCP_Client_diagram.png)

In `process_query`, when the LLM decides it requires a tool to be executed, the client session sends to the server the tool call request. **The returned response is passed in to the LLM**.

![](mcp-course-by-anthropic/L5_MCP_Client_calls_to_MCP_Server.png)

- Run:
```bash
cd L5/mcp_project
source .venv/bin/activate
uv add anthropic python-dotenv nest_asyncio
uv run mcp_chatbot.py
```

## Lesson 6: Connecting the MCP Chatbot to Reference Servers

- [Code example](mcp-course-by-anthropic/L6_Connect_to_MCP_reference_servers_Anthropic_course.ipynb)
- [List of MCP servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
  - [fetch MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch)
  - [filesystem MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem)
- We create a JSON file (`server_config.json`) with all the MCP server configuration needed to connect to the MCP Servers.

![](mcp-course-by-anthropic/L6_Connect_to_multiple_MCP_Servers.png)

## Lesson 7: Adding Prompt & Resource Features

- [Code example](mcp-course-by-anthropic/L7_Adding_Prompt_and_Resource_features.ipynb)
- Resources are read-only data that an MCP server can expose to the LLM application. Resources are similar to GET endpoints in a REST API - they provide data but shouldn't perform significant computation or have side effects.

## Lesson 8: Configuring Servers for Claude Desktop

- It shows how to connect Claude Desktop to the local MCP Servers.
- From the Claude Desktop UI, it configures the [claude_desktop_config.json](./mcp-course-by-anthropic/claude_desktop_config.json)
- [MCP Clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients)

## Lesson 9: Creating and deploying remote servers

- We use [Render](https://render.com/) to deploy our MCP Server.
  - It does not suppor `uv`, so we need to make it compatible with pip: `uv pip compile pyproject.toml > requirements.txt`
  - We also do `echo "python-3.11.11" > runtime.txt`
- We need a GitHub repository so that Render deploys it from there.  
  - https://github.com/hsalami/remote-research
- From Render dashboard
  - Select the GH repo
  - Start Command: `python research_server.py`
  - Deploy
  - https://remote-research.onrender.com/sse
- Resources
  - Deploy Remote MCP servers on CloudFlare [link](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/guides/remote-mcp-server/)
  - Streamable HTTP transport [link](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/blob/main/README.md#streamable-http-transport)

## Lesson 10: Conclusion

- Not covered:
  - Authentication: the March 2025 specification update enables MCP clients and servers to make use of OAuth 2.1
  - Roots: 
    - it's a URI that a client suggests a server should operate.
    - "Only look in these specific folders for the files I need".
    - When a client connects to a server, it declares which roots the server should work with.
- Sampling
  - It allows a server to **request inference from the LLM** they're connected to via the MCP client, giving the user application full control over security, privacy, and cost.
  - It's a way for servers to leverage the LLM's intelligence as part of their processing pipeline.
- **Composability**: an MCP client can be a server and vice-versa
  - Sampling + Composability
  - An orchestrator agent, using an Analysis Agent, a Coding Agent, a Research Agent, etc.
- An official **MCP Registry API**
  1. Discovery
  2. Centralization
  3. Verification
- An MCP server registry helps make agents **self-evolving** by letting them discover and choose their own tools.
  - E.g. published under a [well-known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_URI) folder: https://shopify.com/.well-known/mcp.json
