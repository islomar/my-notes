## Module 1: welcome to the AI for Product Management Course

- AI
  - Machine Learning
  - Deep Learning
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Generative AI, e.g. LLMs
- Two ways product managers should think about AI:
  - As a tool to help you build your product
  - As a capability you build into your product

## Module 2: An overview of AI and product management

- AI’s place in building products:
  1. Data analysis
  - Automatically recognize patterns and trends in a data set
  - Decision making examples
  2. Experimentation
  - Learn what's working and implement changes quickly
  - E.g. suggest what to test for multi-variant feature testing and run tests automatically
  3. Communication
  - Automate the creation of key product documentation
- How product managers can leverage AI in their roles:
  - Analyzing quantitative usage data
  - Prioritizing which features to build
  - Analyzing customer feedback
  - Analyzing NPS responses
  - Generating user stories and personas
  - Backlog management
  - Optimizing the product roadmap
  - Creating **in-app** copy or content
    - Analyze data to identify the right moments for in-app messages
- Two areas that AI will never replace
  - Being **customer-centric**
  - Having good **business sense**

## Module 3: Adapting your software strategy in the AI era

- Three questions to consider when forming your AI strategy:
  1. What areas of your product need to change?
    - Use product analytics to identify areas of friction
  2. What areas of your product will remain?
  3. What completely new additions to your product are now possible?

### Laying a foundation with AI principles (Pendo's ones)
  - Customer-centric approach
  - Transparency and open communication
  - Data governance
  - Optionality and customization
  - Compliance with legal and regulatory frameworks
  - Fairness and equity
  - Thought leadership
  - Setting the tone from the top

### Four levels of AI
  - Level 1: There is no involvement from AI and everything is manual.
  - Level 2: The process is still manual and driven by the human, but AI is there to assist, provide insights, and give recommendations.
  - Level 3: AI drives the process and the human is there to fine-tune, edit, decline, and approve things.
  - Level 4: There is no human involvement and the process is fully automated by AI, like a self-driving car.

## Module 4: AI and the product-led organization

- **Product-led organization**: A business that rallies the entire company around the product so each team can leverage it to achieve their most important outcomes.
- **Six characteristics of product-led organizations**
  1. Align each function around the product
  2. Make decisions with data over gut feel
  3. Use the product as a marketing channel
  4. Have amazing onboarding
  5. Help users help themselves
  6. Collect and use feedback from customers
- **Three benefits of AI in a product-led organization**
  - Getting smarter
  - Helping humans be more effective
  - Improving product delivery  
- How **Marketing** can use AI
  - Use AI tools to analyze product usage and customer feedback to build hyper-targeted campaigns
- How **Sales** can use AI
  - Leverage AI to more effectively identify patterns that signal high engagement and intent
  - Use AI to generate personalized outreach copy
- How **Customer Success** teams can use AI
  - Use AI to analyze more product usage data and customer feedback than ever before
  - AI tool can auto-generate in-app guide campaigns to drive conversion, expansion, or adoption

## Module 5: Powering product-lead growth with AI

- Product-led growth (PLG) is a go-to-market business strategy that focuses on placing a company's software product at the center of the buying journey. 
- **Six principles of product-led growth (PLG)**
  https://www.pendo.io/pendo-blog/6-principles-of-product-led-growth/
  1. Providing a free user experience
    - Free trials
    - Freemium products
    - Product tours
  2. Delivering an "aha" moment as soon as possible
    - E.g. an in-app guide
    - AI can help identify what to offer in the free vs paid versions. E.g. identify users who engage with X feature Y times in the first three months, go on to stay engaged in the product for the remainder of their subscription term.
  3. Committing to best-in-class usability
  4. Delighting users to encourage stickiness
  5. Making purchasing feel like the natural next step
    - In-app notification to take to the buying page
  6. Building in virality at every turn
- **Examples of applying AI to the six PLG principles**
  - Analyzing product usage and conversion data to identify aha moments
  - Creating hyper-personalized onboarding experiences and pricing strategies
  - Extracting themes from feedback to ensure you’re building sticky features
  - Generating in-app content to prompt users to share and collaborate

## Module 6: Making product development smarter

- **Product Management Life Cycle**: A cyclical framework for how great products are built and improved.
- **Phases of the Product Management Life Cycle**
  - Phase 0: Define a Business Outcome
    - Start with a clear business objective that you're looking to achieve
  - Phase 1: Discover
    - Uncover the pain points of both your customers and the larger market.
  - Phase 2: Validate
    - Determine the right solution to move forward with
    - AI-powered tools can allow for **quick analysis of data points** across mediums (e.g. interviews, surveys, in-app polls, service request tickets, etc.) and make recommendations based on the findings
  - Phase 3: Build
    - Partner with engineers and product designers to ensure your idea comes to life as intended
  - Phase 4: Launch
    - Build a launch plan to make sure customers adopt and continue using new functionality
  - Phase 5: Evaluate
    - Use quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the success of a launch
  - Phase 6: Iterate
    - Determine how you can improve what you've built
- Example: we want to increase customer retention by a certain percentage. Questions to ask during discovery:
  - What do typical user flows look like?
  - What's stopping users who churn from achieving their goals?
  - Is there a workflow where users who churn tend to get stuck?
  - What are the trends in user feedback, and is that feedback getting acted upon?
  - Do highly satisfied or "power users" tend to engage in certain behaviors?
  - What features do retained customers engage with the most?
    - Do those usage patterns exist in the rest of your user base?
