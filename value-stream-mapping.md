# Value Stream Mapping

## General

- PACE chart
  - Purpose: Prioritization of highest impact opportunities
  - Anticipated benefit vs Ease of implementation
  - https://my.methodistcollege.edu/ICS/icsfs/mm/lean_tools_pace_prioritization.pdf?target=2ac14fb1-e288-46dc-94d3-2dceef160fc1
  - Review where each task fell within the prioritization grid:
    - Tasks in the **Priority** area of the grid now take top priority, followed by items in the **Action** area.
    - Tasks in the **Consider** area are to be discussed individually to determine if they will be part of the short term plans or left for future projects
    - Tasks in the **Eliminate** area are left fo future projects and not considered a part of the short term plans

## What to do with freed capacity

Freeing capacity is a vital way for labor intensive organizations to increase the proportion of revenue to labor. The effort, though, should not result in layoffs. Rather, freeing capacity enables an organization to accomplish one or more of the following outcomes:

- Absorb additional work without increasing staff
- Reduce paid overtime
- Reduce temporary or contract staffing
- In-source work that's currently outsourced
- Create **better work/life balance** by reducing hours worked
- **Slow down and think**
- Slow down and perform higher-quality work with **less stress and higher safety**
- **Innovate**; create new revenue streams
- Conduct **continuous improvement** activities
- Get to know your customers better (What do they _really_ value?)
- Build stronger supplier relationships
- **Coach staff** to improve their critical thinking and problem-solving skills
- **Mentor staff** to create career growth opportunities
- Provide-cross-training to create greater organizational flexibility and enhance job satisfaction
- **Do the things you haven't been able to get to**; get caught up
- Build stronger interdepartmental and interdivisional relationships to improve collaboration
- Reduce payroll through natural attrition

## Design questions

The following set of questions can be used as a starting point for designing the future state.

### General Questions

- What are the business issues (service quality, product quality, speed, capacity, cost, morale, competitive landscape, impending regulations, etc.) we wish to address?
- What does the customer want?
- What measurable target condition(s) are we aiming for?
- Which process bocks add value or are necessary non-value-adding?
- How can we reduce delays between processes?
- How can we improve the quality of incoming work at each process?
- How can we reduce work effort and other expenses across the value stream?
- How can we create a more effective value stream (greater value to customers, better supplier relationships, higher sales conversion rates, better estimates-to-actuals, lower legal and compliance risk, etc.)?

### Specific Questions

#### Touch Points

- Are there redundant or unnecessary processes that can be eliminated (e.g. excessive approvals)?
- Are there redundant or unnecessary handoffs that can be eliminated or combined (e.g. work that can be done by a single department)?
- Are there processes or handoffs that need to be added?

#### Delays

- Is work being processed frequently enough? Can we reduce batch size of eliminate batching completely?
- Do we have adequate coverage and available resources to accommodate existing and expected future workloads?
- How can we create more capacity or reduce the load at the bottleneck?

#### Sequencing and Pacing

- Is the work sequenced and synchronized properly? Are the processes being performed too early or too late in the value stream?
- Are key stakeholders engated at the proper tiime?
- Can processes be performed concurrently (in parallel)?
- Would staggered starts improve flow?
- How can we balance the workload to achieve greater flow (via combining or dividing processes)?
- Do we need to consider segmenting the work by work type to achieve greater flow (with rotating but designated resources for defined periods of time)?

#### Variation Management

- Is there internally produced variation (e.g., end-of-quarter sales incentives)?
- How can we level incoming workload along the value stream to reduce variation and achieve greater flow?
- Can we reduce variation in customer or internal requirements? How can necessary variation be addressed most effectively?
- Are there common priorization rules in place throughout the value stream?

#### Technology

- Is redundant or unnecessary technology involved?
- Is the available technology fully utilized?
- Are the systems interconnected to optimize data movement?

#### Quality

- How can higher-quliaty input be received by each process in the value stream (to improve the %C&A metric)?
- Is there an opportunity to standardize and error proof work?

#### Labor Effort

- How can we eliminate unnecessary non-value adding work?
- How can we reduce the labor effort in necessary non-value-adding work?
- How can we optimize value-adding work?

#### Value Stream Management

- Do policies need to be changed to enable improved performance?
- Are there organization/departmental/reporting structures that can be changed to reduce conflicting goals or align resources?
- Do existing performance metrics (if any) encourage desired behaviors and discourage dysfunctional behavior?
- What key performance indicators (KPI) will we use to monitor value stream performance?
- Who will monitor the KPIs? How frequently? Who else will results be communicated to?
- What visual systems can be created to aid in managing and monitoring the value stream?
- Are the key processes within the value stream clearly defined with their own KPIs, standardized appropriately, and measured and improved regularly?
